# Flappy-Bill
Flappy Bill is a retake on the classic flappy bird game where you usually would try to flap through openings in the pipes, but in Flappy Bill you must get food while dodging the Aliens AND the plumbing pipes...

I'm making this as my first ever project for SoM, and its the first ever Google extension game I've made.
